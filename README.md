# LSP-PowerShellEditorServices

Convenience plugin to install and run the PowerShellEditorServices language server.

To use this package, install the [LSP](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/LSP) 
package, and the [PowerShell](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/PowerShell) package
for syntax highlighting. Alternatively, you may use Michael Blyons'
[PowerShell syntax rewrite](https://github.com/michaelblyons/PowerShell/tree/sublime-syntax).

This package will download binaries in Sublime Text's `$DATA/Cache` directory.
